# Challenge1 Horiseon Refactor

## Description

The Horiseon marketing agency needed to refactor its website. This means I needed to improve the code without changing the website to make it more accessible. Making the code more accessible ensures that all users can use assistive technology or interact with the page more easily. I worked to make the starter code have semantic HTML and CSS. Organizing the code to be more accessible use.
